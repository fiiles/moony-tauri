# Architecture Decision Records

One ADR records one decision: the context that forced it, what was decided,
and what it costs. ADRs are dated point-in-time records — facts in them
(file names, counts) are true as of the ADR's date and are not kept fresh.

## Rules

- **ADRs are immutable.** An accepted ADR is never rewritten to say something
  different. To change a decision, write a **new ADR** with the next number
  that links back to the one it supersedes. The only edit ever made to an old
  ADR is flipping its `## Status` to `Superseded by [NNNN](NNNN-....md)`.
- Numbering is sequential and zero-padded; the next free number is `0006`.
- Filename: `NNNN-short-kebab-title.md`. Add every new ADR to the index table
  above.
- Keep each ADR to one page or less.

## Template

````markdown
# NNNN. Title

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The situation that forced a decision: facts, constraints, and the
alternatives that were on the table.

## Decision

What was decided, stated actively ("We use X", "Writes are Y").

## Consequences

What becomes easier, what becomes harder, what must now always be done,
and which risks are knowingly accepted.
